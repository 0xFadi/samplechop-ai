# SampleChop AI 🎵

An intelligent audio analysis tool that helps producers find potential sampling points in music, inspired by techniques used by producers like Kanye West and The Alchemist.

## Features 🚀

- **Automatic Chop Point Detection**: Identifies musically interesting moments for sampling
- **Spectral Analysis**: Analyzes the frequency content at each potential chop point
- **Energy Detection**: Finds significant changes in audio energy
- **Visualization**: Visual representation of waveforms and detected chop points

## Installation 📦

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/0xFadi/samplechop-ai.git
cd samplechop-ai

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start 🎯

```python
from samplechop import SampleAnalyzer

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = SampleAnalyzer()

# Load an audio file
analyzer.load_audio("path_to_your_song.mp3")

# Find potential chop points
chop_points = analyzer.find_chop_points(
    threshold=0.5,      # Adjust sensitivity of detection
    min_interval=0.2    # Minimum time between chop points (seconds)
)

# Visualize the results
analyzer.visualize_chop_points(chop_points)
```

## How It Works 🔍

The tool uses several techniques to identify potential chopping points:

1. **Onset Detection**: Finds significant changes in audio that could indicate good chop points
2. **Spectral Analysis**: Analyzes the frequency content to identify interesting moments
3. **Energy Analysis**: Detects changes in audio energy that might indicate transitions
4. **Filtering**: Removes chop points that are too close together for practical use

## Parameters 🎛️

- `threshold` (float, default=0.5): Controls how sensitive the detection is
- `min_interval` (float, default=0.2): Minimum time between consecutive chop points
- `sr` (int, default=22050): Sample rate for audio processing
- `hop_length` (int, default=512): Frame size for analysis

## Example Output 📊

When you run the visualization, you'll see:
- Blue waveform showing the audio signal
- Red vertical lines indicating detected chop points
- The strength and characteristics of each potential sample point
